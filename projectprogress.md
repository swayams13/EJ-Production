# EJ Production Tracker - Daily Progress Log

## Date: 2026-06-27

### What we did today:
- **Optimized Data Fetching:** Fixed massive N+1 query performance issues in the Progress Dashboard by implementing `selectinload` for SQLAlchemy relationships.
- **Cache Busting:** Eliminated persistent Next.js and browser caching issues on the frontend by adding dynamic timestamps to API calls.
- **Project Hold System:** Implemented a brand new "Hold" state for projects.
  - Added `status_note` and `hold_until_date` to the database via SQLite migrations.
  - Added an intuitive UI on the "Edit Projects" page to allow capturing hold reasons and dates.
  - Added "Edit Projects" permanently to the sidebar navigation.
- **Dashboard Hold Metrics:** Split dashboard metrics so that "On Hold" welding requirements do not inflate "Pending" capacity. Created a separate red highlight zone on the dashboard for held work.
- **Roadmap Organization:** Saved the complete Phase 1-18 project roadmap into `phase.md`.
- **Phase 3 Execution (Workforce Intelligence):** 
  - Updated the `users` database table to include `skill`, `department`, `experience`, and `base_productivity`.
  - Built the `/workforce` Next.js dashboard to track daily attendance and display efficiency rankings.
  - Removed `username` and `password` requirements for shop-floor workers, enabling fast supervisor entry.
- **Database Architecture Hardening:** Enforced PostgreSQL strictly across the backend and wrote a fully automated SQLite-to-PostgreSQL migration script (`migrate_sqlite_to_postgres.py`).

### Problems faced:
- The dashboard was very slow to load (15s+) due to hundreds of redundant database queries firing simultaneously.
- When saving changes, the frontend wouldn't update live due to aggressive Next.js static data caching.
- Railway deployments failed to add new database columns because the auto-migration transaction was rolling back if any single column already existed.
- Need to securely migrate existing SQLite data into the new strictly-enforced PostgreSQL database.

### How we solved them:
- Rewrote `calculate_project_progress` to use explicit `selectinload` mapping, drastically reducing load times.
- Implemented `?t=timestamp` cache-busters on frontend API requests to guarantee live data.
- Refactored the `ALTER TABLE` startup script to run each column addition in isolated `try/except` blocks, fixing the Railway deploy.
- Built a secure, automated `migrate_sqlite_to_postgres.py` script that reads credentials directly from `.env` and transfers all data table-by-table.

### What is pending:
- We need to test the Workforce Intelligence module thoroughly with real workers.
- The metrics calculation currently uses placeholders for quality and efficiency scores; we need the precise formulas from management to calculate them based on actual feet welded / defects.

### What needs to be done next session:
- Execute Phase 4 (Smart Task Allocation Engine).
- Connect the new `AttendanceLog` data to the production scheduler so we can avoid assigning tasks to absent workers.
- Build the Daily Scheduler interface for supervisors to assign work based on priority and worker skill.
